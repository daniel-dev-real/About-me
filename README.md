Hi, my name is Daniel

Back-End Developer, Java user (for pain),  Anime-for-Research Enjoyer 

"I code in Java because my front-end skills would make UX designers cry."

About Me

Why back-end? Three honest reasons:

My artistic skills peaked at stick figures (RIP front-end dreams).

I love dissecting how systems actually work — like when I reverse-engineered game mechanics to optimize my PokeMMO tools.

There's something poetic about code that either works or fails spectacularly (no "it works on my machine" excuses).
public class WhyBackend {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         System.out.println("Front-end? Never heard of her.");
}
}



When I'm not battling NullPointerExceptions:

Playing chess games with the same insanity as Rock Lee vs Gaara.

Studying construction of Systems via anime (yes, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it)

Writing Bash scripts to automate my Ubuntu afterlife

Soundtrack of My Coding Sessions

"In the end, it doesn't even matter..."System.out.println("...Linkin park's forever");
